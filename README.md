A website for an AI consultancy

This Website began as a Bootstrap 5.3.2 project that was part of a codecademy Bootstrap module.
Upon completion of this project I decided to continue the build out and dive deeper into Bootstrap.
My goal is to continue this build out and make a site while networking, having fun and improving my skills.
Perhaps this site will eventually become a consultancy for businesses interested in leveraging the power of AI?
